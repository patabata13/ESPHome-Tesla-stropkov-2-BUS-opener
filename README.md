# ESPHome Tesla Stropkov 2-Bus Opener

A DIY **Tesla Stropkov 2-Bus intercom opener** using an **ESP8266 (WeMos D1 Mini)** and a **4-channel relay module** to emulate button presses for remote door unlocking.

This is my first ever DIY project with ESP Home as well as first entry in Github. So be nice and any suggestions and modifications are welcomed :)


## üöÄ Features
- **Emulates button presses** for:
  - `1` (Required to press when you're trying to open door without anyone calling you)
  - `Lock` (Opening the door)
  - `Headset Pickup` (Simulating lifting the intercom handset)
- **ESPHome-powered** for seamless Home Assistant integration
- **WiFi connectivity** for remote control
- **Stable operation** with state restoration and boot flicker prevention


## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements
**Please note, that some soldering skills are required to make this. For the original intercom board as well as for the D1 mini board**
| Component         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| [ESP8266 (D1 Mini)](https://www.laskakit.cz/wemos-d1-mini-esp8266-wifi-modul/) | Microcontroller running ESPHome |
| [4-Channel Relay Module](https://www.laskakit.cz/4-kanaly-rele-modul-5vdc-250vac-10a/) | Controls button press simulation |
| Tesla Stropkov 2Bus Intercom | Target intercom system (my model is Elegant, but it should work with others) |
| Wires & Connectors | For wiring the relay to the intercom |
| 3D printer | For a case (3D model available for download) |

## üéÆ Home Assistant Integration
Once ESPHome is flashed and running, Home Assistant will automatically detect the device. You can control the relays via the HA dashboard or automations.

## üèóÔ∏è Installation
1. Flash ESPHome firmware to the D1 Mini.
2. Wire the relays to the Tesla Stropkov intercom (I've used twisted pairs from a leftover UTP cable).
3. Connect to WiFi and add the device to Home Assistant.
4. Test by triggering the relays.
5. Use helper to change switch entity of a Relay_1 `Headset Pickup` to a lock entity
6. Use provided automation (or edit it to your needs) to automate relay switching for automatic unlocking.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This is not plug and play solution. Some soldering to a original intercom board is required. You are doing this at your own risk!
This project is intended for educational and personal use. Ensure compliance with any local regulations before modifying intercom systems.
